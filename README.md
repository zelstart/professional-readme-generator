## Description
This application will use nodejs to generate a professional looking README.md file based on user input. This application uses inquirer v8.2.4 package to ask the user questions about their project, and the answers will be saved and used to populate a README file template. It will ask the user for the project name, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, license used, tests, questions, github username, and email. 

## Installation
- Download/clone the repo to your device. 

## Usage

- Open the repo with your favorite code editor. 
- Make sure you have nodejs on your device. 
- In the terminal, enter `node index.js`
- The terminal will be populated with questions regarding your readme for you to respond to.
- When all the questions have been answered, the terminal will confirm that a file has been created. It will be named "generatedREADME.md"
- You can then rename your readme and place it into your own repo and modify it as you see fit.
